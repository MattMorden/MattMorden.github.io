Welcome to my blog!

My current intention with this is to make monthly posts giving updates on things that I think are important. There may be more than one post in a month if I have additional content to share, or less if there is a lack of content or I am simply too busy.

I think this is a great way to not only solidify what I am learning and working with, but to help out new developers who are struggling with common scenarios such as
- What should I be learning?
- Where / How can I learn?
- How are these things being addressed in the industry / other workplaces?

As a bonus, I will have something formally documented to look back on as my career advances to see how far I have come, and how some opinions have changed.

##Additional Topics
Some additional topics that I plan on covering, include:
1. Generic things to know when starting your career
2. Unit Testing (And TDD)
3. Documentation
4. Code Projects

##About Me
I'm currently an Intermediate Full-Stack Developer, working mainly in .NET. I graduated from Fanshawe College's Computer Programmer Analyst program in December 2016.

##Disclaimer
The things that will be posted in my blogs will be my opinions and experiences, and I will link any formal documentation to important topics and examples.
