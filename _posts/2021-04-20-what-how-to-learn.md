# What to learn / How to learn
First thing's first. Figure out what you want to learn. Though this may seem daunting at first, given the extensive amount of content on the internet, and thousands of open-source projects -- Everyone has a general idea of what they want to build. Ask yourself, "Do I want to build a mobile application?" If the answer is yes, move into a more specific question:
- For iOS? Take a look at the getting started tutorial for Swift [https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/SwiftUI]
- For Android? Check out the first app tutorial at [https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp]
- For Both? Maybe it's worth looking into something like Xamarin, which allows you to build cross platform applications. See [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/xamarin/hello-world-tutorial/intro]

It's worth noting that you don't need to learn everything, so it's worth focusing on what is relevant to you (and what you are currently working on). There's far too much information out there to be fluent in every language and every framework, and nobody expects that of you. More often than not, you'll be faced with something that you don't know, or haven't touched in several months (or years) and need to be able to retrieve that information quickly. That brings us to the next point, how to learn.

As you may have guessed, the best spot to learn independently is the official documentation of whatever it is you are seeking out. When you don't know what to learn, it's worth diving into the tutorials for a given framework. For example, with .NET there is a great tutorial with pictures and code samples to get you up and running. [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/introduction]
As you progress through the tutorials, you'll get an idea of other things that Microsoft, and other developers find useful, like debugging and publishing an app, or writing unit tests (I plan on making a post on this subject later). You'll more than likely stumble upon things that aren't exciting to you, or you've already learned, and that's okay. You can skip over them, as the intention here is to fill the "what do I learn" question.

A few things that I would recommend learning, that I wish school had taught or focused more on are:
- Unit Testing
- Load Testing
- Dependency Injection
- Additional tools (Postman/Polly/Redis) -- don't get too hung up on tools!


To sum things up, it's worth seeking out official documentation whenever possible. A good framework/library will be properly documented and would even provide some implementation code samples. A great example would be Polly, which allows transient-fault handling, and additional HTTP client configuration. The project has all of the code posted on github, and has some amazing implementation docs. [https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly]

When all else fails, Stackoverflow is the way to go :)
